Scene Machine is a tool for app developers and graphic designers that makes procedural generation of textures and Scene Materials easy. 

Textures can be generated as stand-alone images or tiles, and in standard sizes (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048 and 4096x4096). Image effects may also be applied to textures.

Scene Materials can be generated, stored and retrieved for other scenes. You may paint materials with Apple Pencil

Scene Machine supports import and export of .obj, .dae and .scn files for easy interchange with Blender. You may draw a shape, and convert to a Geometry.

## Features

### Noise & Generators

- [X] Choose Image Size: 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, 4096x4096
- [X] Zoom in and out of images - Scale 0.2 to 8.0
- [X] Save Image
- [X] Undo Changes

### SpriteKit Noise
Create common types of noises using `SpriteKit`.

- [X] Generate any noise in SpriteKit: Perlin, Voronoi, Ridged, Billow, Checker, Cylinder
- [X] Color Gradients - Adds step colors to the otherwise black and white noise.

### Pedal2DMetal
Procedural Image generators with `Metal`

- [X] Noise { Voronoi, Caustic, Waves }
- [X] Overlay { Lens flare, Halo, Sunbeams, Caustic Refraction }
- [X] Tiles { Checkerboard, Hexagons, Truchet, Bricks, Diagonal Lines, Interlaced }

### Image Composition
Mix 2 images, using multiple `CoreImage` techniques

### Metal Kernel Shaders
Image CIKernels built on Metal programming language.
More about: [Shaders](https://github.com/Farini/Scene-Machine/blob/main/Scene%20Machine/Shaders/ShadersReadme.md#about-shaders)

### Scene Machine
Test and export `SceneKit` scenes.

- [X] Show a Geometry's `UVMap`
- [X] Save and export scene `.scn`, and `.dae` files or `*.scnassets` folder.
- [X] Background `HDRI` Images
- [X] App Geometries
- [X] Add Geometry from `.dae`, `.scn` and `.obj` files.
- [ ] Have some sample code + shaders written in `Metal`  - `SCNProgram`
- [ ] Test animated characters - Bones(in blender) vs SCNSkinner(Swift)

### Scene Materials
Create SceneKit Materials - `SCNMaterial`

- [X] Material Model for Persistency
- [X] SceneMaterial, and SubMaterialData: Codable -> Persist `SCNMaterial`
- [X] Material Editor (may need improvements)
- [X] UVMap
- [X] Save UVMap Image
- [X] Save Materials
- [X] Allow use of **Apple Pencil** to draw images.
    
### Model
See this apps's model readme: [Here](https://github.com/Farini/Scene-Machine/blob/main/Scene%20Machine/Model/ModelReadme.md#scene-machine-data-model)
